## Quick start

In the working repository

```
npm i @ultrastark/us-mixin@latest
```

Then import in the following order in you main.scss style and where you need it

```scss
@import 'myColor.scss'; //https://docs.ultrastark.ch/docs/projects/us-mixin/classes/color#installing
@import '~@ultrastark/us-mixin/mixin';
@import '~@ultrastark/us-mixin/utilities';
```

**Note**
- `us-mixin/mixin` have to be imported in every scss file that needs they mixins
- us-mixin/utilities should be imported **only once**. If not, it's gonna create useless classes
- mixin and utilities work good together but you could only use one of the both if you need it

**Attention**
If you use the `color mixin` and want custom color, you need another step: [wiki](https://github.com/ultrastark/us-mixin/wiki/color)
